## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the branch of Machine Learning (ML) that involves predicting labels, such as 'Survived' or 'Not'. Such models learn from labelled data, which is data that includes whether a passenger survived (called "model training"), and then predict on unlabeled data.

These are generally called train and test sets because
- You want to build a model that learns patterns in the training set, and
- You then use the model to make predictions on the test set.

We can then calculate the percentage that you got correct: this is known as the accuracy of your model.

### How To Start with Supervised Learning

As you might already know, a good way to approach supervised learning is the following:
- Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on your data set;
- Build a quick and dirty model, or a baseline model, which can serve as a comparison against later models that you will build;
- Iterate this process. You will do more EDA and build another model;
- Engineer features: take the features that you already have and combine them or extract more information from them to eventually come to the last point, which is
- Get a model that performs better.

A common practice in all supervised learning is the construction and use of the **train- and test- datasets**. This process takes all of the input randomly splits into the two datasets (training and test); the ratio of the split is usually up to the researcher, and can be anything: 80/20, 70/30, 60/40...

## Supervised Learning I: classification

There are various classifiers available:

- **Decision Trees** – These are organized in the form of sets of questions and answers in the tree structure.
- **Naive Bayes Classifiers** – A probabilistic machine learning model that is used for classification.
- **K-NN Classifiers** – Based on the similarity measures like distance, it classifies new cases.
- **Support Vector Machines** – It is a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier that builds a model to classify a case into one of the two categories.

### Decision trees

It is a type of supervised learning algorithm. We use it for classification problems. It works for both types of input and output variables. In this technique, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. Moreover, it is based on the most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.

The Decision Tree is a powerful non-linear classifier. A Decision Tree makes use of a tree-like structure to generate relationship among the various features and potential outcomes. It makes use of branching decisions as its core structure.

There are two types of decision trees:
- **Categorical (classification)** Variable Decision Tree: Decision Tree which has a categorical target variable.
- **Continuous (Regression)** Variable Decision Tree: Decision Tree has a continuous target variable.

Regression trees are used when the dependent variable is continuous while classification trees are used when the dependent variable is categorical. In continuous, a value obtained is a mean response of observation. In classification, a value obtained by a terminal node is a mode of observations.

Here, we will use the `rpart` and the `rpart.plot` package in order to produce and visualize a decision tree. First of all, we'll create the train and test datasets using a 70/30 ratio and a fixed seed so that we can reproduce the results.

```r
# split into training and test subsets
set.seed(1000)
ind <- sample(2, nrow(breastCancerData), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7, 0.3))
breastCancerData.train <- breastCancerDataNoID[ind==1,]
breastCancerData.test <- breastCancerDataNoID[ind==2,]
```

Now, we will load the library and create our model. We would like to create a model that predicts the `Diagnosis` based on the mean of the radius and the area, as well as the SE of the texture. For ths reason we'll use the notation of `myFormula <- Diagnosis ~ Radius.Mean + Area.Mean + Texture.SE`. If we wanted to create a prediction model based on all variables, we will have used `myFormula <- Diagnosis ~ .` instead. Finally, `minsplit` stands for the the minimum number of instances in a node so that it is split.

```r
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
myFormula <- Diagnosis ~ Radius.Mean + Area.Mean + Texture.SE

breastCancerData.model <- rpart(myFormula,
                                method = "class",
                                data = breastCancerData.train,
                                minsplit = 10,
                                minbucket = 1,
                                maxdepth = 3,
                                cp = -1)

print(breastCancerData.model$cptable)
rpart.plot(breastCancerData.model)
```

We see the following output and a figure:

```
      CP       nsplit rel error   xerror     xstd
1  0.69930070      0 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.06688883
2  0.02797203      1 0.3006993 0.3006993 0.04330166
3  0.00000000      2 0.2727273 0.3006993 0.04330166
4 -1.00000000      6 0.2727273 0.3006993 0.04330166
```

![Full decision tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsom/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/master/static/images/decisionTreeFull.png "Full decision tree")

The parameters that we used reflect the following aspects of the model:
- `minsplit`: the minimum number of instances in a node so that it is split
- `minbucket`: the minimum allowed number of instances in each leaf of the tree
- `maxdepth`: the maximum depth of the tree
- `cp`: parameter that controls the complexity for a split and is set intuitively (the larger its value, the more probable to apply pruning to the tree)

As we can observe, this might not be the best model. So we can select the tree with the minimum prediction error:

```r
opt <- which.min(breastCancerData.model$cptable[, "xerror"])
cp <- breastCancerData.model$cptable[opt, "CP"]
# prune tree
breastCancerData.pruned.model <- prune(breastCancerData.model, cp = cp)
# plot tree
rpart.plot(breastCancerData.pruned.model)

table(predict(breastCancerData.pruned.model, type="class"), breastCancerData.train$Diagnosis)
```

The output now is the following Confusion Matrix and pruned tree:

```
    B    M
B  245  34
M   9   109
```

![Pruned decision tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsom/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/master/static/images/decisionTreePruned.png "Pruned decision tree")

_Question: **What does the above "Confusion Matrix" tells you?**_

Now that we have a model, we should check how the prediction works in our test dataset.


```r
## make prediction
BreastCancer_pred <- predict(breastCancerData.pruned.model, newdata = breastCancerData.test, type="class")
plot(BreastCancer_pred ~ Diagnosis, data = breastCancerData.test,
     xlab = "Observed",
     ylab = "Prediction")
table(BreastCancer_pred, breastCancerData.test$Diagnosis)
```

The new Confusion Matrix is the following:

```
BreastCancer_pred   B   M
                B 102  16
                M   1  53
```

### Random Forests

Random Forests is an ensemble learning technique, which essentially constructs multiple decision trees. Each tree is trained with a random sample of the training dataset and on a randomly chosen subspace. The final prediction result is derived from the predictions of all individual trees, with mean (for regression) or majority voting (for classification). The advantage is that it has better performance and is less likely to overfit than a single decision tree; however it has lower interpretability.

There are two main libraries in R that provide the functionality for Random Forest creation; the `randomForest` and the `party: cforest()`.

Package `randomForest`
- very fast
- cannot handle data with missing values
- a limit of 32 to the maximum number of levels of each categorical attribute
- extensions: extendedForest, gradientForest


Package `party: cforest()`
- not limited to the above maximum levels
- slow
- needs more memory

In this exercise, we will be using the `randomForest`. First, let's train the model:

```r
library(randomForest)
set.seed(1000)
rf <- randomForest(Diagnosis ~ ., data = breastCancerData.train,
                   ntree=100,
                   proximity=T)

table(predict(rf), breastCancerData.train$Diagnosis)
```

The output is the following:

```
   B   M
B 249  12
M   5 131
```

We can also investigate the content of the model:

```r
print(rf)
```

The output shows the individual components and internal parameters of the Random Forest model.

```
Call:
 randomForest(formula = Diagnosis ~ ., data = breastCancerData.train,      ntree = 100, proximity = T)
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 100
No. of variables tried at each split: 5

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 4.28%
Confusion matrix:
    B   M class.error
B 249   5  0.01968504
M  12 131  0.08391608
```

We can view the overall performance of the model here:

```r
plot(rf, main = "")
```

![Error rate plot for the Random Forest model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsom/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/master/static/images/error-rate-rf.png "Error rate plot for the Random Forest model")

We can also review which of the variables has the highest "importance" (i.e. impact to the performance of the model):

```r
importance(rf)

varImpPlot(rf)
```

The output is the table and the figure below:

Let's try to do a prediction of the `Diagnosis` for the test set, using the new model. The margin of a data point is as the proportion of votes for the correct class minus maximum proportion of votes for other classes. Positive margin means correct classification.

```r
BreastCancer_pred_RD <- predict(rf, newdata = breastCancerData.test)
table(BreastCancer_pred_RD, breastCancerData.test$Diagnosis)

plot(margin(rf, breastCancerData.test$Diagnosis))
```

The output is the table and figure below:

## Supervised Learning II: regression

### Linear regression


Linear regression is to predict response with a linear function of predictors. The most common function in R for this is `lm`. In our dataset, let's try to investigate the relationship between `Radius.Mean`, `Concave.Points.Mean` and `Area.Mean`. We can get a first impression by looking at the correlation of these variables:

```r
## correlation between Radius.Mean and Concave.Points.Mean / Area.Mean
cor(breastCancerData$Radius.Mean, breastCancerData$Concave.Points.Mean)
## [1] 0.8225285
cor(breastCancerData$Concave.Points.Mean, breastCancerData$Area.Mean)
## [1] 0.8232689
```

Lets create a short version of our data
```r
bc <- select(breastCancerData,Radius.Mean,Concave.Points.Mean,Area.Mean)
```


Let's build now a linear regression model with function `lm()` on the whole dataset:

```r
bc_model_full <- lm(Radius.Mean ~ Concave.Points.Mean + Area.Mean, data=bc)
bc_model_full
```

The output is the following:

```
Call:
lm(formula = Radius.Mean ~ ., data = bc)

Coefficients:
        (Intercept)  Concave.Points.Mean            Area.Mean  
            7.68087              2.72493              0.00964  
```

This tells us what are the coefficients of `Concave.Points.Mean` and `Area.Mean`, in the linear equation that connects them to `Radius.Mean`. Let's see if we can predict now the mean radius of a new sample, with `Concave.Points.Mean` = 2.724931 and `Area.Mean` = 0.00964.

Let's make predictions on our training dataset and visualize
```r
preds <- predict(bc_model_full)

plot(preds, bc$Radius.Mean, xlab = "Prediction", ylab = "Observed")
abline(a = 0, b = 1)
```
![Prediction Plot GLM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsom/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/master/static/images/lm_full_dataset.png "Prediction Plot GLM")

We can also have a better look at what the model contains with `summary(bc_model_full)`:

```
Call:
lm(formula = Radius.Mean ~ ., data = bc)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-4.8307 -0.1827  0.1497  0.3608  0.7411 

Coefficients:
                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)         7.6808702  0.0505533 151.936   <2e-16 ***
Concave.Points.Mean 2.7249328  1.0598070   2.571   0.0104 *  
Area.Mean           0.0096400  0.0001169  82.494   <2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 0.5563 on 566 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.9752,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.9751 
F-statistic: 1.111e+04 on 2 and 566 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```
But his only provides the evaluation on the whole datset that we sued for training. we don't know how it will perform on unknown dataset. So, let's split our dataset into training and test set, create the model on trainign set and visualize the predictions

```r
set.seed(123)
ind <- sample(2, nrow(bc), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.75, 0.25))
bc_train <- bc[ind==1,]
bc_test <- bc[ind==2,]


#Let's build now a linear regression model using the training data and print it:
(bc_model <- lm(Radius.Mean ~ Concave.Points.Mean + Area.Mean, data=bc_train))

#We can also view the model's summary
summary(bc_model)


######Evaluating graphically 
#Let's make predictions on our training dataset and store the predictions as a new column
bc_train$pred <- predict(bc_model)

# plot the ground truths vs predictions for training set
ggplot(bc_train, aes(x = pred, y = Radius.Mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(color = "blue")
```
![Prediction Plot GLM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpsom/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/master/static/images/lm_train_dataset.png "Prediction Plot GLM")

You will note that it is quite similar to when using whole dataset

Let's predict using test data
bc_test$pred <- predict(bc_model , newdata=bc_test)

```r
# plot the ground truths vs predictions for test set and examine the plot. Does it look as good with the predictions on the training set?
ggplot(bc_test, aes(x = pred, y = Radius.Mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(color = "blue")
```

Now let's use the RMSE and the R_square metrics to evaluate our model on the training and test set.

#####1. Evaluating model using RMSE - on training set
```r
#Calculate residuals
res <- bc_train$Radius.Mean-bc_train$pred
#For training data we can also obtain the residuals using the bc_model$residuals

# Calculate RMSE, assign it to the variable rmse and print it
(rmse <- sqrt(mean(res^2)))
[1] 0.5624438

# Calculate the standard deviation of actual outcome and print it
(sd_bc_train <- sd(bc_train$Radius.Mean))
[1] 3.494182
```
So we can see that our RMSE is very small compared to SD, hence it is a good model

######Exercise 1 Calculate RMSE for the test data and check if the model is not overfit.

#####2. Evaluating model using R Square - on training set

```r
# Calculate mean of outcome: bc_mean. Print it
bc_mean <- mean(bc_train$Radius.Mean)

# Calculate total sum of squares: tss. Print it
tss <- sum((bc_train$Radius.Mean - bc_mean)^2)

# Calculate residual sum of squares: rss. Print it
err <- bc_train$Radius.Mean-bc_train$pred
rss <- sum(err^2)

# Calculate R-squared: rsq. Print it. Is it a good fit?
(rsq <- 1-(rss/tss))
[1] 0.974028
```
This again confirms that our model is very good as the R_Square value is very close to 1

###### Exercise 2 Calculate R_Square for the test data and check if the model is not overfit.


### Generalized Linear Model (GLM)

GLM, as the name implies, generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. It unifies various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. The corresponding function is `glm()`; it fits generalized linear models, specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor and a description of the error distribution.

We will perform Linear Regression using GLM with family =Gaussian. GLM with the log link function we are modeling the linear regression as ln(f(y)).  type for response indicates the type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors,  and the alternative "response" is on the scale of the response variable. 

And we will do visualization and calculate RMSE adn RSquare for the training data after generating our model and compare the results for linear regression we got above.


```r
myFormula <-Radius.Mean ~ Concave.Points.Mean + Area.Mean
bc_model2 <-glm(myFormula, family=gaussian("log"),data=bc_train)

summary(bc_model2)

```

The output is the following:

```
Call:
glm(formula = myFormula, family = gaussian("log"), data = bc_train)

Deviance Residuals: 
    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  
-8.8018  -0.5850   0.1779   0.7005   1.8351  

Coefficients:
                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)         2.285e+00  7.747e-03  294.89  < 2e-16 ***
Concave.Points.Mean 8.571e-01  1.517e-01    5.65 2.98e-08 ***
Area.Mean           4.639e-04  1.476e-05   31.44  < 2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

(Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 1.303883)

    Null deviance: 5103.49  on 418  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance:  542.41  on 416  degrees of freedom
AIC: 1305.2

Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6
```

We can now make prediction and visualize the result:

```r
bc_train$pred2 <-predict(bc_model2,type = "response")

ggplot(bc_train, aes(x = pred2, y = Radius.Mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(color = "blue")
  
  
######RMSE
res <- bc_train$Radius.Mean-bc_train$pred2

(rmse <- sqrt(mean(res^2)))
[1] 1.137781

# Calculate the standard deviation of actual outcome and print it
(sd_bc_train <- sd(bc_train$Radius.Mean))
[1] 3.494182

######R_Sq
# Calculate mean of outcome: bc_mean.
bc_mean <- mean(bc_train$Radius.Mean)

# Calculate total sum of squares: tss
tss <- sum((bc_train$Radius.Mean - bc_mean)^2)

# Calculate residual sum of squares: rss.
err <- bc_train$Radius.Mean-bc_train$pred2
rss <- sum(err^2)

# Calculate R-squared: rsq. Print it. Is it a good fit?
(rsq <- 1-(rss/tss))
[1] 0.8937169

```
The plot, the value of RMSE (higher than in linear regression) and RSquare (lower than that for linear regression) indicates that this model is not as good as linear regression.
